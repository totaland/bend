# Shaders in Bend

AIs wrote this tutorial, for AIs, from the logs of building
`demos/app_slash_boss_3d`. A human will revise it later. Report anything wrong
on GitHub.

A fast shader in Bend is one fork tree that ends in flat loops. The reference is
`demos/app_slash_boss_3d/bend3d.bend`, a rasterizer that draws 1920x1200 at 120
FPS (8.0 ms a frame) on a 10-core M4 mini. Every ms below is that machine and
that frame unless stated.

## The machine

A `!` call (a bang) ships one call to the GPU, which runs a cube of 16384 lanes
(128 x 128). A parallel let `a b = f(x) g(y)` creates one task per call plus a
join task. A kernel iteration grows the fork tree breadth-first until the
frontier fills the cube, then every lane runs its task to the end: ~0.4-0.5 ms
plus the slowest lane. A continuation that forks again lands in the next
iteration. A def is flat when it has no parallel let, no bang, no closure apply,
no non-flat call and no non-tail self call: it compiles to one native tail loop
(`spin_N` in the C). A non-tail self call becomes a segmented continuation: a
frame per call. Memory is one heap shared by the CPU and the GPU: unified on
Apple; managed on CUDA, where each page faults across PCIe on the first touch by
the other side. A machine with no GPU, or `--gpu off`, runs bangs on the CPU
pool. Divergent per-lane work (a search, a tree walk per ray) is faster there
than on the GPU. Aim for 4^7 leaves per bang, one per lane, and sweep one fork
level either side on the device: the CPU pool is flat across that sweep, so it
cannot tune it. Fewer leaves leave lanes idle (256 of 16384 busy: 234 ms for a
frame that takes 28 ms at 4096); more cost an iteration each.

## A frame

1. Host: build the scene (mesh, project, light, cull) into a quadtree of 64-px
   cells, one cons list of flat screen triangles per cell. 1.6 ms.
2. One bang: fork four ways per node, five levels to the cells, two more over
   each cell's list, to 16-px tiles: 4^7 = 16384 = the lane cube. A tile filters
   the cell's list into its own and walks it in flat loops. Draw ~6 ms.
3. The last frame rides down the same tree as `Four` quadrants; each tile leaves
   its quadrant unused, so the runtime sinks it there. Drop 0 ms.
4. Host: free the last scene as one branch of the next build. 0.35 ms.

```
2048 root   Frame.node, k=5   fork 4   levels 1-5  -> 64-px cells (32 x 32)
64-px cell  Cell.fork, k=2    fork 4   levels 6-7  -> 16-px tiles (16384)
16-px tile  Tile.b16 = 4 Tile.b8 = 4 Tile.b4       straight-line, no fork
4-px square Blk.go            one flat loop over the list, four Blk
2-px block  Blk.four          one Pix, or four
```

The root is the power of two over the frame (2048 over 1920x1200); a region off
the frame, or empty, answers one `Pix` before any fork (`Frame.sky`). A fork per
pixel drowns in scheduling; a fork per cell leaves lanes idle. A fold per level
plus a fold per pixel: 600 ms and 31 iterations a frame, against 8 ms and 1.

## The code

The list is the one shape a flat loop walks with no stack. One list per cell,
not per pixel: a list shared by pixels is contended atomics.

```python
type Tris is Data:
  TNil{}
  TCons{+tri: Tri, next: Tris}

type Cells is Data:
  CNil{}
  CLeaf{+n: U32, +ts: Tris}
  CQua{tl: Cells, tr: Cells, bl: Cells, br: Cells}
```

The fork. `Frame.show` bangs once and returns the tree beside the image, so the
host still owns it. `Image.open(old) -> Four` splits the last image at the call
(a `Pix` opens into four); each tile receives `old: Four` and ignores it.

```python
def Frame.node(+k: Nat, c: Cells, old: Four) -> Image:
  match k c:
    case _ CLeaf{_, ts}:
      Cell.fork(2n, ts, 0, old)
    case 1n+e CQua{tl, tr, bl, br}:
      Four{oa, ob, oc, od} = old
      a b c d = Frame.node(e, tl, Image.open(oa)) Frame.node(e, tr, Image.open(ob))
        Frame.node(e, bl, Image.open(oc)) Frame.node(e, br, Image.open(od))
      Qua{a, b, c, d}
    case _ _:
      Pix{0}

def Frame.show(+cells: Cells, old: Image) -> Image & Cells:
  (Frame.node!(5n, cells, Image.open(old)), cells)
```

`Cell.fork(+k, +cs, ..)` has the same shape over the cell's list and calls
`Tile.go` at `0n`. The tile: one flat loop reads each entry once for a block of
`Hit{w, c, i}`, then frees its list after the last read.

```python
def Blk.go(ts: Tris, +i: U32, +h0: Hit, +h1: Hit, +h2: Hit, +h3: Hit) -> Image:
  match ts:
    case TNil{}:
      Blk.four(h0, h1, h2, h3)
    case TCons{t, n}:
      Blk.go(n, (i + 1 : U32), Hit.step(t, i, h0), Hit.step(t, i, h1),
        Hit.step(t, i, h2), Hit.step(t, i, h3))

def Tile.go(cs: Tris, +x: U32) -> Image:
  +h = {Hit{0.0, 0, 0} : Hit}
  +ts = Tris.filter(cs, x, TNil{})
  Tile.fin(Blk.go(ts, 1, h, h, h, h), ts)
```

`Blk.four` answers `Pix{k0}` when the four hits are one triangle, else a `Qua`
of four `Pix`; `Tile.fin` walks the list to `TNil` and returns the image.
Transparency: the filter fills a second list (`Filt{+n, ts, bs}`) and `Blend.go`
walks it in order over the blocks after the opaque loop. Text and HUD: strokes
as opaque quads nearer than the world (`Text.put`, `Quad.put` at inverse depth
3000), layered by depth, order-free. The host: one parallel let per def, the
last scene freed as a branch by `Cells.drop(4n)`: four forked levels in
`Frame.node`'s shape, then `Tris.free` loops.

```python
def Scene.build(+t: F32, used: Cells) -> Cells:
  a b c = Hero.build(t) Stage.build(t) Cells.drop(4n, used)
  Cells.m4(a, b, c, CNil{})
```

A turn keeps the last image and scene as one pair: the build takes the old
scene, the bang the old image. An `IO.now()` step sits between them: a bang that
follows the host's forks in one evaluation runs on the CPU pool.
`Window.frame(window, image)` shows the image.

```python
def Turn.go(+t: F32, last: Image & Cells) -> IO(Image & Cells):
  (old, used) = last
  do IO<Image & Cells>:
    cells : Cells = Scene.build(t, used)
    now : Nat <- IO.now()
    IO.pure(Image & Cells, Frame.show(cells, old))
```

## Any scene

The pixel never sees the scene. The fork tree opens each node once on the way
down and hands each tile one short flat list; the pixel loop marches that list.
For triangles, voxels, distance fields and sprites alike, the host walks the
world once per frame into per-tile candidates (the primitives, columns or spans
whose screen bounds meet the tile); the device reads only those. A field with no
scene data (a procedural distance field) is the best case: one flat loop per
pixel on a U32 step counter. A per-ray tree walk fails three ways: a fold over a
tree is a non-tail recursion (a frame per node), the lanes of a SIMD group
diverge, and a `+` tree pays an atomic per node per pixel. A reported case: a
voxel world as a `+Data` quadtree of 32x32 columns, read per ray: 176 ms a
frame, against 24 ms for the same picture computed per pixel with no scene data
(the reporter's machine). The fix: keep the editable map on the host, and hand
each tile a flat list of the column words its rays cross (a 32-high column is
one U32 of bits) each frame. An `Array` has one owner, so it cannot go down a
fork tree: build lists.

## Data

- Records of scalars ride in registers through every call and fork; a boxed
  record shared by every vertex is an atomic count per use. `Tri` is 24 flat
  words (barycentric, depth and colour planes, mode, alpha, box): one F32 per
  64-bit word, ~200 B loaded per entry per walk.
- A wide record round-trips the stack: a 52-word record per list entry made the
  draw 6.3 -> 12.1 ms; a 22-word camera on every mesh call, +2-4% build. Build
  wide data where used (`Hook.cam(F)`).
- A def or continuation takes at most 247 words ("an arity over 247"): four
  15-field records in one parallel let fail to compile. Wrap a big header in a
  constructor of the tree it heads.
- Use the typed `pick(c, a: F32, b: F32)` and `word(c, a: U32, b: U32)`; the
  generic `Bool.pick` boxes its words.
- Tables are `word` chains and Bool-column matches. A `match` on U32 literals is
  a bit-by-bit tree with the default arm copied per branch: +21% host C, +6.4%
  `.gpu`, 1-4% slower.
- Pass a constant as a `~` template argument (a def like `Screen.w()`), not as a
  parameter: a parameter rides in every task.
- Tessellate in screen space: ~20-px patches; a circle gets `max(4, ceil(pi
  sqrt(r/2)))` segments. Slivers and sub-pixel triangles pass every box test and
  pile 100-400 entries on a tile (42 ms frames); exact triangle-vs-cell overlap
  holds the worst tile at 80-110. Length past that is not the cost: a cap of
  16/32/64 entries per tile changed nothing.

## Ownership

The compiler decides borrows; `+` does not. The checker needs `+` for a second
use. The compiler borrows a boxed parameter (not an `Array`) that the def only
matches or passes to a borrower: every read is `term_peek`, no count. It owns
one that the def returns, stores in a constructor, or passes to an owner. An
owned use of a value that is used later shares it: a count on the value and,
since sealing is per type, on every node of that type, silently. So `+ts` above
borrows: `Blk.go` only matches, `Tile.fin` consumes last. So the scene is
host-owned, borrowed by the bang, and returned (`Frame.show`). Read through
counts, the frame costs 8.0 -> 16.5 ms (draw 6.0 -> 14.1).

- Two consumers of one list share it: 45 ms frames and a 448 s Metal compile. A
  `+` where one use would do heats its type (symreg 2.83 -> 3.30 s).
- A def that returns its argument shares it: `Bool.pick(Cloth, c, a, b)` on a
  tree gave 14 keeps and a hot type. Match the selector and recurse into one
  field (`Cells.put` has eight arms for this). Refolding a matched `+` record at
  a call is an owned argument (8-16 keeps): pass the fields.
- The last reader of a borrowed list needs a later use, else it becomes the
  owner: `Tile.fin` walks the lists after the pixels read them (as dead
  parameters the runtime's sink is 0.55 ms slower).
- A bang inside a `do` continuation flips its callee to owner (the tree is a
  captured local): 2x reads. Bang in a pure def that returns the pair.
- Drop the last image inside the fork tree (a dead `Four` per tile) and the last
  scene on the host by a walk (35% faster than the runtime sink); never inside a
  bang: 12.9 ms. `_ = x` drops a value on the spot.
- Never let the device own the scene: draw 6.2 -> 12.0 ms.

Verify in the emitted C (`bend x.bend -o x.c`): in a def's body, `term_peek` is
a borrow; `term_keep`, `ctr_take` and `rfc_seal` are counts. A new keep in a
device def is a regression.

## Cost model

- Mesh, project, light and cull on the host: 0.6-1.6 ms in parallel lets; on the
  GPU 14-33 ms (a P-core is ~75x a lane on serial work).
- Leaves are flat loops over cons lists; joins are constructors. Unroll the
  squares: `Tile.b16` = 4 x `Tile.b8` = 4 x `Tile.b4`; folded into one recursive
  def they made the draw 5.5 -> 12.6 ms.
- Walk the list once per 4x4 square, not per pixel or per 2x2 block: 6.6 -> 5.6
  ms. Anything that depends on x alone, once per column pair: sky per pixel 3.8
  ms, per block 1.6, per column pair ~1.0 less.
- The draw is throughput-bound, not tail-bound: splitting heavy tiles +0.03 ms,
  32-px cells +0.85. A per-lane early-out saves nothing while a SIMD sibling
  runs the body.
- Drops: `Image.drop` forked at every `Qua` (~100 ops of task machinery per
  node), 2.6 ms; base's `Image.free(7n)`, seven levels then a sink, 1.6 ms;
  inside the draw's tree, 0; a whole image sunk on one lane, 19.8.
- Host: one parallel let per def (a second costs an iteration: build 2.32 ->
  1.93 ms); every extra branch or level ~0.1 ms; a 0.3 ms job loses to the pool
  wake-up; a heavy branch serializes a 16-ring chunk (1.2-1.6 ms): split it.
- CUDA: a scene built by the host and read by the device faults each page over
  PCIe, both ways: 17-19 FPS on an RTX 4090 (25 ms `gpu_pass` + ~21 ms host
  turn) for the frame the M4 draws in 8. Keep a whole frame on one side of the
  bus.

## Measuring

Probe as the game does (`SLASH_PROBE=1200`): scripted frames headless, each
stage's microseconds as medians after warm-ups. Single-run medians vary 0.3-0.5
ms across days, and the second binary of a GPU pair runs ~7% faster: compare by
3-4 interleaved 1200-frame pairs in both orders, plus an A-vs-A pair. Check
frames pixel-identical (`SLASH_DUMP=T` prints one as a tree) before trusting a
gain. Count the keeps in the C and the `.gpu` bytes (+6% was a real 1-4%
slowdown). Probe without audio: it wakes `audiomxd` at 70-100% of a core.

## Do not

1. Read the scene through counts: 2x per read, 8.0 -> 16.5 ms.
2. Fold per level, or bang twice a frame: 600 ms against 8.
3. Recurse non-tail in the bang, or fold a tree per pixel: draw 5.5 -> 12.6.
4. Mesh on the GPU: 14-33 ms against 0.6-1.6.
5. Fork per pixel or per `Qua`: drop 2.6 vs 1.6 ms.
6. Leave slivers and sub-pixel triangles: 42 ms frames.
7. Wide records through frames and joins: 2x per entry.
8. `match` on U32 literals: +21% C, +6.4% `.gpu`.
9. Generic `Bool.pick` on words or trees: boxed words, hot types.
10. Free the scene in a bang (12.9 ms) or the image on the host (milliseconds).
11. Trust one run, or the CPU pool (the 600 ms frame took 11 ms there), as a
    device measurement.

## Queued CUDA inference arrays

The native CUDA runtime queues `Array.q4go`, `rmsq`, `swq`, `gdn`, `atq`
and `amq` on one ordered stream. `Array.q4emb` reads a row of an MLX
q4/group-64 matrix as BF16-rounded embedding activations; `Array.roq`
generates rotary cosines and sines with the Bend FP32 rounding boundaries.
Their arrays must remain owned and unmodified until `Array.q4wait` returns.
Host readers must wait first. `Array.q4new` allocates a zero-filled F32
array whose initialization may be queued or fused into its first CUDA
writer; CPU, Metal and JS initialize it immediately. `Array.q4cuda()`
returns 1 only with a live native CUDA heap and 0 on the other backends,
so an inference package can select CUDA without a general GPU bang.

Build with CUDA headers, driver and NVRTC libraries available through
`CUDA_HOME`, and run the compiled program with `--gpu <span>`.
`BEND_Q4_REQUIRE_CUDA=1` refuses unsupported inference geometry rather
than falling back to host model math. This is a specialized MLX q4g64
path: attention has at most 4096 positions and a head dimension of at
most 256. Check each operation's geometry before using another model.
The CUDA code preserves BF16 rounding and fixed sum order, with FMA
contraction disabled. The base-library Bend bodies remain the reference
on other backends; different backend transcendentals can differ.

Optional CUDA environment switches:

- `BEND_Q4_HOST_LINKS=1`: store large-block free links in host memory.
  This is for inference-only programs; general GPU evaluator passes
  fail explicitly while it is enabled.
- `BEND_Q4_IMMUTABLE_PACK=1`: keep an exact transpose of packed q4
  matrix bits on the device. It costs one extra copy of those matrices.
- `BEND_Q4_IMMUTABLE_CONST=1`: retain exact device copies of RMS,
  DeltaNet and attention constants. These two immutable caches require
  the source arrays to stay alive at stable allocations, unchanged,
  for the entire process. Do not enable them for mutable arrays or
  replace/free cached model parameters during the process.
- `BEND_Q4_GRAPH=1`: replay the same token kernels through an updated
  CUDA graph. It is off by default; profiling uses direct launches.
- `BEND_Q4_TRACE=1`: print queue counts to stderr.
- `BEND_Q4_PROFILE=1`: print CUDA event timings; leave it unset when
  measuring normal throughput.

The pure rotary table cache covers positions below 2048 and computes
larger positions directly on CUDA. The immutable caches are opt-in and
released with the process. The tests in `tests/base/array_q4mv.bend`,
`array_q4mv_tree`, `array_rmsq`, `array_swq`, `array_gdn`, `array_atq`,
`array_amq`, `array_q4new`, `array_q4emb` and `array_roq` specify expected
bit patterns, queued ownership and initialization behavior.
